# Hello!

I'm a software developer from the US. Currently I'm working on monte, it's a really big project.
It's a bit daunting, but you have to dream big to win big! I would love to see the Rust community flourish
and I think Polars is a fantastic example of bringing the benefits of Rust to the wider developer community.
